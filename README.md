# PostgreSQL REST API with Node.js

### Access Canary Islands open data about cultural events (previously inserted on a psql database) using a REST API

- In order to interact with the PostgreSQL database I'm using the modules 'pg-promise' and 'bluebird'.
- In this project I've included a script "createdb.sql" to create our database, tables, users and the instructions necessary to add some rows from a .csv file.
